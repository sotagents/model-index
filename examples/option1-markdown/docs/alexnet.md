# Summary

**AlexNet** is a classic convolutional neural network architecture. It consists of convolutions, max pooling and dense layers as the basic building blocks

## How do I load this model?

To load a pretrained model:

```python
import torchvision.models as models
squeezenet = models.alexnet(pretrained=True)
```

Replace the model name with the variant you want to use, e.g. `alexnet`. You can find the IDs in the model summaries at the top of this page.

To evaluate the model, use the [image classification recipes]((https://github.com/pytorch/vision/tree/master/references/classification)) from the library.

```bash
python train.py --test-only --model='<model_name>'
```

## How do I train this model?

You can follow the [torchvision recipe](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/tree/master/references/classification) on GitHub for training a new model afresh.
