# Collection

To keep related models together, you can create Collections. The metadata format for collections is the same as for models
and all member models **inherit** all the metadata and can override/add to it. 

The fields of a collection are exactly the same as fields of a [Model](model.html) - see the description there. 

## A full example

In this example we have two variants of the `Mask R-CNN` model, one with a ResNet-50 backbone and one with a ResNet-101 backbone. These models belong together as variants of the Mask R-CNN, so we link them via a `Mask R-CNN` model collection.
